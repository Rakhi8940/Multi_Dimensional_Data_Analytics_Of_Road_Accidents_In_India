# 🚗 Road Accident Analysis

Road Accident Analysis is a comprehensive data analytics project that explores patterns, trends, and contributing factors in road accidents using statistical analysis and data visualization. Using Python, it performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and generates actionable insights from accident data across multiple dimensions.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze road accident trends across states and years (2003-2016)
- Identify patterns in accident causes, vehicle types, and time of occurrence
- Examine the impact of safety accessories on accident severity
- Understand the relationship between road characteristics and accident rates
- Visualize demographic trends in accident victims and offenders
- Generate insights for traffic safety improvement
